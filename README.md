# AML (Advanced Mathematical Logic) Package - Version 1.0 Released

We are excited to announce the release of the **AML (Advanced Mathematical Logic)** package, now available on CTAN. This package provides a set of **10 custom symbols** for advanced mathematical logic, useful for typesetting complex logical expressions and formulas.

### Key Features:
- **Custom Symbols**: The AML package defines the following new logic symbols for use in mathematical typesetting:
  - `$\ifL$` - Custom "if" symbol
  - `$\elseL$` - Custom "else" symbol
  - `$\elifL$` - Custom "else if" symbol
  - `$\toL$` - Custom "to" symbol
  - `$\alsoL$` - Custom "also" symbol
  - `$\additionalcontent$` - Custom "additional content" symbol
  - `$\doneL$` - Custom "done/end" symbol
  - `$\logicalEquL$` - Custom "from that before is equalize to" symbol
  - `$\trueL$` - Custom "true" symbol
  - `$\falseL$` - Custom "false" symbol

- **Designed for Logic Notation**: These symbols are tailored for logical expressions, making it easier to format complex algorithms or proofs in LaTeX.

- **GPL License**: The AML package is distributed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**, meaning users are free to use, modify, and distribute it.

### Installation:
To install the AML package, run the following commands:

1. Download the AML package files.
2. Execute `latex aml.ins` to extract the necessary files.
3. Place the generated `aml.sty` file in your LaTeX directory.

### Usage:
To use the package, include it in the preamble of your LaTeX document:
